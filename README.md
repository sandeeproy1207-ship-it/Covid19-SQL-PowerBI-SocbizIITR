Hello #dataenthusiast today I am excited to share my new portfolio project on üåü COVID-19 ANALYSIS USING SQL & POWER BIüåü 

It was a fantastic experience to work with such a huge amount of data in front of your face, Scrolling through the Excel sheet to visually get insights in a single glance and interact with the data is what drives me to push forward with this project.



 üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Let me walk you through the Report - 

You can find the raw dataset at: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

This Report mainly focuses on CASES, DEATHS & VACCINATIONS and contains 2 pages i.e, Global Stats & India's Stats. 

üî∂  The first page (Global Stats) KPI shows the Total Cases, Deaths, and vaccinations done from 08-01-2020 to 21-08-2023 with over 330K+ rows of data. 

‚óà Yearly, Quarterly and Monthly dynamic slicers are given to drill dig inside Line charts time of Total Cases, Deaths, and vaccinations done globally.

‚óà Column Charts shows the world's Top 8 countries with the most cases, death and vaccinations along with Percentage(%) of Cases/population, Death/Population and vaccination/population (don't miss out on the tooltip for stacked information)

üî∑  The Second Page (India's Stats) is completely dynamic and KPI shows the Total Cases, Deaths and Vaccinations done in India from the mentioned date above.

‚óà 2 different kinds of LINE CHARTS are used to show the Total cases, deaths and Vaccinations and each serves a different purpose from the others.

üî∏ Tools I have used in this project - 

¬ª Microsoft Excel - Data Extraction, Data Cleaning, Data Filtering

¬ª PostgreSQL - Solved Queries to find complex information

¬ª Microsoft Power Bi - Data Visualization

¬ª Microsoft PowerPoint - Data presentation

¬ª Photoshop 2020 - Redesigned the logo as per project needs



üîπ A brief explanation of work done inside tools :



‚Ä¢ In Excel, lots of unnecessary columns were present in the dataset which were removed, and a new dataset with the desired columns is used for this project



‚Ä¢ In PostgreSQL, CSV file has been imported with a lot of changes in data types made inside Postgres, SQL commands used in queries -

SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, ALIAS, GROUP BY, HAVING, LIKE, SUM(), ROUND(), CTE (common table expression), WINDOWS FUNCTION, VIEWS, etc.



‚Ä¢ In Power BI, Imported the PostgreSQL COVID-19 database in power bi and made visualization from the query output, made relationships between tables, and created some calculated Column and DAX Measures for visualization



‚Ä¢ Two Buttons are shown in KPIs i.e. Eraser (Clears all Filters) and NEXT (Takes you to the next page) Both the PNG icons are taken from https://www.flaticon.com/
